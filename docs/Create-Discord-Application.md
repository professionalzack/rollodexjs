# Create a Discord Application

If you do not have an existing Discord account, [you'll need to do that first](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/219470277-Getting-Started). Once you have an account, follow the steps below to configure an application.

1. Go to [Discordâ€™s developer page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
1. Click on **Create an application**
1. Set a name (avatar too, if you feel like it)
1. Click **Bot** in the left panel
1. A popup will appear asking you to confirm, click **Yes, do it!**
1. Take note of your token, you'll need it later
